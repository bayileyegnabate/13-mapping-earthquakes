# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview of Project:
- The goal of this project is to visually show the difference between the magnitudes of Earthquakes all around the world
- use GeoJSON earthquake data from USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitude of earthquakes for the last seven days
- we will be using JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Use Leaflet lib to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and add interactivity
