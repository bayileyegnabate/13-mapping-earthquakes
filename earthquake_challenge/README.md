# Mapping Earthquakes and Tectonic Plates

## Overview of Project:
- The main goal of this project is to visualize Earthquakes around the globe based on their magnitudes; include an overlay of the Tectonic Plates.
- use [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitude of earthquakes for the last seven days from [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes).
- use [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. 
- use [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) lib to plot the data on a [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) through an API request and add interactivity
